## 🎯 How It Works

```
Your Google Sheet (Data)
         ↓
    Your Bot (Running on PC)
         ↓
    WhatsApp Message: "What's shark fin price?"
         ↓
    Bot reads Google Sheet
         ↓
    Claude AI processes question
         ↓
    WhatsApp Reply: "Current price: RM 1,540/kg"
```

**For you:** Just ask questions via WhatsApp  
**For your boss:** Just ask questions via WhatsApp  
**No dashboards, no logging in, no learning curves!**

## 📊 Google Sheets Setup

You'll create a Google Sheet with tabs like:

- **Price History** - Your AutoCount price CSV data
- **Stock Levels** - Current inventory
- **Property Rentals** - Rental income schedules
- **Property Expenses** - Utilities, loans, council fees
- **Any other data you want**

The bot reads ALL tabs and can answer questions about any of them!

---

## 💬 Example Questions Your Bot Will Answer

**Seafood Trading:**
- "What's the current price for shark fin?"
- "Show me all invoices from January"
- "Which customers bought sea cucumber?"
- "What's our highest selling product?"

**Property Management:**
- "What's my total rental income this month?"
- "Which properties have unpaid rent?"
- "When is the next loan payment due?"
- "Show me all utility bills for Sunway Tower"

**Combined:**
- "What's my total income from both businesses?"
- "Show me all expenses this month"
- "Which tenants are behind on payments?"

**The bot is smart** - it understands natural language, so you can ask in many different ways!

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Official APIs only** (not like OpenClaw which has security issues)  
✅ **Sandboxed** (can only access what you give it permission to)  
✅ **Your data stays in Google Sheets** (you control it)  
✅ **No system access** (can't read your computer files)  
✅ **Encrypted connections** (WhatsApp, Google, Claude all use HTTPS)

**Initial setup:** FREE (except time)

**Monthly costs for testing:**
- Node.js: FREE

## 📈 When You're Ready to Sell to Clients

After testing for 1-2 months, you can:
